# In-Depth Comparison of Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4 in Vibe Coding

## Introduction

Vibe coding is a revolutionary software development approach that allows developers to describe problems in natural language, with an AI Large Language Model (LLM) generating the corresponding code. This method, proposed by computer scientist Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, emphasizes simplifying the coding process through AI, enabling even non-technical individuals to participate in software development. The core of vibe coding lies in the model's ability to accurately understand natural language prompts and generate high-quality, executable code. This report provides an in-depth comparison of Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4 in the field of vibe coding, focusing on their code generation capabilities, benchmark performance, real-world task performance, context window, pricing, and user feedback.

## Model Overviews

It is a hybrid reasoning model optimized for high-capacity tasks such as coding and in-depth research, with a 200,000 token context window. Claude Sonnet 4 excels in code generation, instruction following, and tool use, and is priced at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens [Source: Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 4].

## Key Requirements for Vibe Coding

Vibe coding requires a model to be proficient in the following areas:

-   **Natural Language Understanding:** Accurately parse both short and complex user descriptions.
-   **High-Quality Code Generation:** Produce functionally correct and well-structured code.
-   **Efficient Execution:** Respond and generate code quickly, reducing the number of iterations.
-   **Context Handling:** Process large codebases or complex prompts when necessary.
-   **User-Friendliness:** Provide an intuitive interactive experience suitable for users with varying technical skills.

## Benchmark Performance

Benchmarks are a crucial indicator of a model's code generation capabilities in vibe coding tasks. The following table shows the performance of the two models on relevant coding benchmarks:

| Benchmark          | Claude Sonnet 4                                  | Gemini 2.5 Pro                        | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **SWE-bench**      | 72.7% (80.2% with parallel test-time compute)    | 63.2%                                 | Tests ability to fix GitHub issues and other SWE tasks. |
| **Terminal-bench** | 35.5% (41.3% with parallel test-time compute)    | Not provided                          | Tests terminal command generation and execution.      |
| **LiveCodeBench UI**| 48.9%                                            | 69.0% (GA), 75.6% (Preview 05-06)     | Tests UI-related code generation.                     |
| **Aider Polyglot** | 61.3%                                            | 82.2% (GA), 76.5% (Preview 05-06)     | Tests code editing capabilities.                      |

**Analysis:**

-   **SWE-bench:** Claude Sonnet 4's score (72.7%) is significantly higher than Gemini 2.5 Pro's (63.2%), indicating its superiority in handling complex software engineering tasks like fixing GitHub issues [Source: Entelligence: Claude 4 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro].
-   **LiveCodeBench and Aider Polyglot:** Gemini 2.5 Pro performs better in some UI-related and code editing tasks, but Claude Sonnet 4 is more consistent and better at following instructions.
-   **HumanEval:** The previous generation model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, scored 93.7% on HumanEval. While Gemini 2.5 Pro's specific HumanEval score is not publicly available, its performance on similar benchmarks suggests it is slightly less competitive [Source: TextCortex: Claude 3.5 Sonnet].

## Real-World Coding Task Performance

Real-world task tests provide a true measure of a model's performance in vibe coding scenarios. A comparative test by Composio demonstrated the two models' performance on the following tasks [Source: Composio: Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. Claude 4 Sonnet]:

### Building a Google Sheets AI Agent:

-   **Claude Sonnet 4:** Generated over 2500 lines of code in a single pass without needing follow-up prompts, performing exceptionally well.
-   **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Took 6 minutes to generate a similar amount of code, but was less efficient.

### Finding and Fixing Bugs:

-   **Claude Sonnet 4:** Fixed all bugs within 2-3 minutes and added code checks and tests.
-   **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Fixed all bugs but took over 10 minutes.

### Adding a New Feature (Focus Mode):

-   **Claude Sonnet 4:** Quickly implemented the feature but had a minor text persistence issue.
-   **Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Required manual context adjustments due to tool issues but generated code with no logical errors.

**Summary:** Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrates superior performance in speed, accuracy, and code quality, especially in vibe coding scenarios that require rapid iteration.

## Context Window and Pricing

| Feature             | Claude Sonnet 4 | Gemini 2.5 Pro |
| ------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| **Context Window**  | 200k tokens     | 1M tokens      |
| **Input Token Cost**| $3 / million    | $1.25 / million|
| **Output Token Cost**| $15 / million   | $10 / million  |

-   **Context Window:** Gemini 2.5 Pro's 1 million token context window gives it an advantage when dealing with large codebases or complex prompts. However, for most vibe coding tasks, 200,000 tokens are sufficient.
-   **Pricing:** Gemini 2.5 Pro is more cost-effective, making it suitable for large-scale use or budget-constrained scenarios.

## User Feedback

User feedback on social media (like X) indicates a preference for Claude Sonnet 4 in coding tasks. For example, one user stated, "In my experience, Claude Sonnet 4 performs better on coding-related tasks" [Source: X Post by @shreyansh_0x0_]. However, Gemini 2.5 Pro is also popular among some developers due to its free tier and integration with the Google ecosystem (e.g., Gemini CLI).

## Other Considerations

-   **Multimodal Support:** Both models support visual input, but this feature has less impact on vibe coding, which primarily relies on text prompts.
-   **Tool Integration:** Claude Sonnet 4 offers robust coding support through Claude Code and GitHub Copilot, while Gemini 2.5 Pro provides similar functionality through the Gemini CLI and Google AI Studio.
-   **Speed:** Claude Sonnet 4 is faster in real-world tasks, making it ideal for vibe coding scenarios that require quick iterations.
